# On the Intersection of Context-Free and Regular Languages

This repository includes code supporting [Pasti et al.'s (2023)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.52) efficient algorithm for intersecting weighted finite-state automata and weight context-free grammars.

## Installation and Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/rycolab/bar-hillel.git
cd bar-hillel
pip install -e .
```

The code for the generalized Bar-Hillel construction is the `intersect_fsa_Îµ` method in `rayuela/cfg/cfg.py`. Test cases are provided in `rayuela/test/cfg/test_epsilon_Bar_Hillel.py`.
